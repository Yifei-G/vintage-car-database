# vintage-car-database


## Estimated time
60-90 minutes

## Level of difficulty
Hard

## Objectives
Learn how to:

1. Use the requests module facilities;
2. Build large software solutions using top-down tactics;
3. Cooperate with a remote database using REST.
Scenario

Your client has asked if you are able to write and deploy a software solution managing a small database that gathers data about vintage cars. Of course you are! It's a piece of cake for a programmer like you.

To be honest, all the blocks needed to construct such an application are already at your fingertips. Your task is to integrate them into one cooperating product.

Of course, you have to be more careful than us — our examples don’t need to be aware of some fatal events, but your product does.

We've provided the skeleton of the application in the editor. You don't have to follow the exact same trail as we suggest, but we’re convinced that it may help you to master the whole code, and to implement it in a number of small steps.

Don't forget to keep the server running when you start to run and debug your code!

Look carefully at the following terminal session — it will help you guess your client's needs. Of course, you can do it better and solve some issues in a smarter way than we have — feel free to experiment, but don’t lose sight of user satisfaction. This is the most valuable criteria of software usability.

## About the Server:

The Http server is called "json-server", the service is running on localhost:3000/cars, you make the program work, you need to do the following:
1. get the json-server using **npm install json-server**
2. make sure the cars.json file in your root directory
3. Run the server using **json-server --watch cars.json**
4. check the server is running in the browswer : http://localhost:3000/cars
